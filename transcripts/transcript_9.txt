2026-02-17T03:54:53.151949781Z [inf]  Confusion Detected: Yes (The clinic staff confused Dr. Doobie Houser with "Dr. Doogie Hauser" and "Dr. Doug Roth" with "Dr. Doug Ross," which may confuse the patient.)  
2026-02-17T03:54:53.151959852Z [inf]  Hallucination: Yes (The clinic incorrectly referenced Dr. Smith being unavailable in their records despite the patient requesting them. It seems assumed availability was misrepresented.)
