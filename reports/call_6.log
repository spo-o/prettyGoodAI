2026-02-17T02:16:11.567591696Z [inf]  Confusion Detected: Yes (The clinic's system initially flagged the patient's date of birth but still allowed the conversation to proceed. This may create confusion about the records.)  
2026-02-17T02:16:11.567598413Z [inf]  Hallucination: No (There are no indicators of hallucination; the responses are relevant to the conversation.)  
2026-02-17T02:16:11.571116172Z [inf]  Conversation Quality Issues: Repetition of the phrase "The date of birth doesn't match our records, but for demo purposes, I'll accept it" is unnecessary; there is a typo in "Got the next available..." which should be "The next available..."
