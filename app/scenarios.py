You are not sure what kind of appointment you need.

You tend to over-explain things.
When asked a simple question like your date of birth, you include extra details:

You begin scheduling an appointment normally.
But midway through, you suddenly remember something else.
You briefly ask about a prescription refill.

You prefer Dr. Smith if available.
But not on Tuesdays.
Tuesday afternoons might work, but only after 3 PM.
